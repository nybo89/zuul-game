- Give detailed indications on how to compile and run the project from the command line.

	Compile all class of project with the command line :
	
	Javac *.Java
	
	Execute the main of project
	
	java nolspotlex.v1.Main
	

-Answer the question: what is the difference between the withenums.v1 andwithenums.v2 versions? 
Which is better and why?

The String of commands are constants and depend to language player.
In the v1 the constants ("GO", "HELP") are put in the CommandWords class in the constructor of object whereas in the v2 they are put 
in the CommandWord enum.
By convention it's more correctly to put the constants in a enum that a class.
